  "readme": "# react-stdio [![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/ReactTraining/react-stdio/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://travis-ci.org/ReactTraining/react-stdio\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-stdio.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-stdio\n\n[react-stdio](https://npmjs.org/package/react-stdio) lets you render [React](https://reactjs.org/) components on the server, regardless of the backend technology you're using.\n\nAs its name suggests, other processes communicate with react-stdio using standard streams. The protocol is JSON, so any environment that can spawn a child process and write JSON to its stdin can use the server. Requests are handled serially, so responses are issued in the same order requests are received.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you have node installed, you can install using npm:\n\n    $ npm install -g react-stdio\n\nThis will put the `react-stdio` executable in your [`npm bin`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/bin).\n\nIf you don't have node installed, you can download the executable for your architecture from [the releases page](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-stdio/releases).\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation, execute `react-stdio` to start the server.\n\nTo render a React component, write a JSON blob to stdin with any of the following properties:\n\n    component       The path to a file that exports a React component (required)\n    props           Any props you want to pass to the component (optional, default is {})\n    render          The type of rendering (optional, default is renderToString)\n\nIf the request is successful, the server will put a JSON blob with `{\"html\":\"...\",\"context\":...}` on stdout. If the request fails for some reason, the JSON will have an `error` property instead of `html`.\n\nExample:\n\n    $ echo '{\"component\":\"./MyComponent\",\"props\":{\"message\":\"hello\"}}' | react-stdio\n\nIf you'd like to use a render method other than [`renderToString`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdomserver.rendertostring) or [`renderToStaticMarkup`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdomserver.rendertostaticmarkup) you can pass a path to a file that exports your rendering function. The signature of your `render` function should be:\n\n```js\nfunction render(element, callback) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis function is asynchronous so you have time to do data fetching before you render if you wish. Call `callback(error, html)` when you're finished.\n\n## Environment\n\nYour component file is loaded in a vanilla node.js environment. If you need additional code transforms to run (e.g. using webpack or Browserify) you should create your bundle first and tell react-stdio to load your bundle instead of the plain component file. If you're using webpack to build your bundle, you'll want to use `\"libraryTarget\": \"commonjs2\"` in your config so the bundle exports the component using `module.exports = MyComponent`.\n\nAlso, since react-stdio uses the `stdout` stream for all program output, all writes your code makes to `process.stdout` (including `console.log` statements) are redirected to `process.stderr`.\n\n## Integrations\n\n* [Elixir/Phoenix](http://blog.overstuffedgorilla.com/render-react-with-phoenix/)\n* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/aaronvb/rails_react_stdio)\n\nIf you'd like to add an integration here, please submit a PR.\n\n## About\n\nreact-stdio is developed and maintained by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).
