It captures options and sends them to webpack compiler. You can also find functionality for initializing a project and migrating between versions. For the time being, it is backwards-compatible with the CLI included in webpack itself.\n\n## Migration from webpack v1 to v2\n\nThe `migrate` feature eases the transition from [version 1](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) to [version 2](https://gist.github.com/sokra/27b24881210b56bbaff7). `migrate` also allows users to switch to the new version of webpack without having to extensively [refactor](https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/).\n\n`webpack-cli migrate <config>`\n\n[Read more about migrating](MIGRATE.md)\n\n## Creating new webpack projects\n\nThe `init` feature allows users to get started with webpack, fast. Through scaffolding, people can create their own configuration in order to faster initialize new projects for various of use cases.\n\n`webpack-cli init webpack-addons-<package>`\n\n[Read more about scaffolding](SCAFFOLDING.md)\n",
